# Diox

The ultimate state management for both front and back ends.


## Motivations

This framework is deeply inspired by Redux and Vuex, which I used for some time. Compared to them,
Diox has several advantages :

- Standalone (no dependency)
- Extremely light (~300 lines of code, 5Kb uncompressed)
- Fast and optimized by design
- Scalable out of the box without using any additional NPM module
- Compatible with any front-end library such as React or VueJS
- Easy to use, with a very small learning curve and simple concepts


## Example

```typescript
